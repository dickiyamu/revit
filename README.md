# honeybee-revit

<b>Honeyebee / Dragonfly plugins for Revit.</b>

# Installation

In order to test this plugin out, please go to [Releases](https://github.com/ladybug-tools/honeybee-revit/releases), and download appropriate version of the ZIP that matches your version of Revit. 

Once you have that ZIP, please remember to *unblock* it before unzipping the contents into the following location: `C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Roaming\Autodesk\Revit\Addins\{version}`
- `Honeybee.Revit.addin` goes directly into that folder
- The rest of the contents in the ZIP file go into folder called `Honeybee.Revit`, so just make a new folder, and copy paste them there.
